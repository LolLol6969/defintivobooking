Open Source Website Template for Hospitality
This project is a cutting-edge website template specifically designed for hotels, B&Bs, and other hospitality structures. Created by Orlando K., it stands out by adopting a striking "Liquid Glass" aesthetic, inspired by the futuristic interfaces of the latest iOS (e.g., iOS 26). This style gives the site a luxurious, modern, and engaging visual presence.

Objective and Stylistic Vision
The primary goal is to offer a sophisticated and visually impactful online presence. The "Liquid Glass" design is implemented through:

Transparencies and Depth Effects: Elements simulate layers of glass, using blur and depth effects to highlight the underlying content.

Fluid and Iridescent Colors: Delicate, shifting gradients create an elegant and contemporary atmosphere.

Soft Animations: Smooth transitions and user interactions mimic the movement of liquid, providing an intuitive and pleasant browsing experience.

This aesthetic is intended to elevate the perception of the hospitality structure, communicating innovation and attention to detail.

Technical Details and Licensing
Open Source Code: The entire project is public and available for anyone to inspect, modify, and use, encouraging community collaboration and development.

License: It is released under the Apache License 2.0.

What this means: This highly permissive license allows the code to be used in commercial projects, modified, and redistributed, ensuring maximum freedom of use (with the only requirement being to maintain the original copyright notice).

Non-Profit Mission
It is stressed that this project has no goal of profit or gain for Orlando K. It is a direct and voluntary contribution to the Open Source community, aimed at making professional and stylistically advanced web tools accessible to everyone in the tourism sector, promoting innovation and accessibility.
